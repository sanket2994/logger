This is a git repository for  generic logger in c .

The logger contains the following :
	1. It contains 4 log levels :
			a. LOG_EMERG 
			b. LOG_CRITICAL
			c. LOG_INFO
			d. LOG_DEBUG
	  The log levels are in the decreasing order with EMERG being the highest level.
	  the log level prints all the logs of the levels above it .
	  i.e if log level is INFO it will print all the info , critical and emerg logs.
	  whereas if the level is emerg it will only print emerg logs.
	  debug level will print logs of all levels.

	2. Time stamp as a optional feild.
	   if the program is compiled with flag TIME_STAMP then time stamp will be printed .
	   we need to define this flag in Makefile.
	
The logger has a global structure g_log using which we need to set the log level and time stamp.

you can write your sample program to test the logger in the app directory with file name main.c
then just do make.

	$ sudo make

a build folder will be created in which you will find the executable just run it .
	

to clean all the object files and main executable file just run make clean
	$ sudo make clean


Do let me know if any problems with logger
